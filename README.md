[First sprint]: 

Repo was created and readme file, no modules to add yet

    I am thinking on having two external files like .txt with source or .bh just with a link that automatically install all the required modules so we save time in the presentation

    Ideally we could pull everything from an empty virtual machine and have a working aplication loaded in seconds

SQL architecture was designed, but may need further inspection

[step 1] Before anything, there is a file "venv.txt" that generates a virtual environment, then we can run step 2:

        use:
            source venv.txt

[step 2] To start, there is a link here to the medules required for the aplication to work

        use:

            source requirements.txt
